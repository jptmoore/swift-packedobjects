# swift-packedobjects

## Swift wrapper for Packedobjects that uses a simple String/NSData interface.

### Introduction

Packedobjects provides a simple API to very concisely compress XML based on a predefined schema. This schema is a valid subset of XML Schema to facilitate writing network protocols.

### Setup

When you open the example in Xcode you will see the files in red need to be added. These can be copied from https://github.com/jptmoore/packedobjects/tree/master/ in the src and schema directories.

### Usage

Scroll the picker to the file you want to test. The output in the textview is a result of compressing the selected XML file and decompressing the result back as a string.
